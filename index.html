        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Amal Baby Mathews, a software engineer.

            I work on cool tech like machine learning and AI.
            
            Training these models can be like giving a toddler fingerpaints - messy but sometimes brilliant!
            
            Natural language processing (making machines understand us) is like deciphering a constantly changing code.  But that's what keeps it interesting!
            
            Reinforcement learning? That's like training a digital pet with rewards and nudges (and maybe some treats for me too!).
            
            Beyond tech, I love hitting the gym, watching sci-fi movies, and hanging with friends.
            
            I may speak tech, but I'm just a human figuring things out in this crazy world.
            
            Let's chat if you want to connect!</p>

        <h2>Experimenting with NEAT for Stock Trend Prediction</h2>

<p>As an intermediate AI Engineer, I'm always fascinated by exploring new approaches to existing problems. This project delved into the world of Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), a technique for evolving neural network architectures. My goal? To investigate its potential for predicting stock trends.</p>

<h2>Technical Details</h2>


<ul>
  <li>NEAT Library: The project utilized the NEAT library (link to documentation: <a href="https://lnkd.in/g3YP4CAA">https://lnkd.in/g3YP4CAA</a>).</li>
  <li>Dataset: Historical data for TSLA stock, including Open, Close, High, and Low prices.</li>
  <li>Goal: Predict future trends (upward/downward) instead of absolute stock prices.</li>
  <li>Network Input: The model achieved better results when fed with the previous day's OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data compared to using only the past 5 days' closing prices.</li>
  <li>Visualization: 
    <br><br>

    <img src="images\neat2.jpeg" alt="gif generator" style="width: 70vw; height: auto;"></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Why NEAT?</h2>

<p>While established models like SARIMA exist for stock prediction, NEAT offers a unique advantage. Its ability to evolve neural network architectures through generations allows the network to automatically discover optimal configurations for the specific task. This holds the potential to surpass hand-crafted architectures.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Predicting the stock market remains a complex and challenging task. This project served as an exploratory experiment, and the results do not guarantee future success. It's crucial to conduct thorough research and due diligence before making investment decisions.</p>

<h2>Skills Gained</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding and applying NEAT principles for neural network evolution.</li>
  <li>Data preprocessing and feature engineering for financial data.</li>
  <li>Training and evaluating neural networks for time series prediction.</li>
  <li>Experiment design and analysis for evaluating model performance.</li>
  <li>Utilizing Web development skills creating a complete webpage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>I'm eager to explore NEAT's capabilities further, applying it to other challenging problems. Additionally, combining NEAT with established techniques could potentially lead to even better results. Feel free to discuss your thoughts on NEAT and its potential in the comments below!</p>

        <h2>Diving into NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT)</h2>
        <p>Hey everyone! Today I'm taking a deep dive into a fascinating paper by Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen: Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). This groundbreaking work explores how to evolve neural networks not just for better weights, but for better structures too!</p>
        <p>Imagine this: You're training a robot arm to grab a cup. Using traditional methods, you tweak its "muscle" settings (weights) endlessly. With NEAT, you also evolve the arm's anatomy itself, maybe growing extra fingers or adjusting their length! This leads to much faster and more creative solutions.</p>
        
        <h2>How NEAT Works</h2>
        <h3>Historical Markings</h3>
        <p>Think of these as birthmarks for each part of the network. They keep track of how each node and connection came to be, preventing "reinventing the wheel" and ensuring valuable structures survive.</p>
        <h3>Speciation</h3>
        <p>Like in nature, NEAT encourages diversity by grouping similar networks into "species." This prevents one dominant design from wiping out all others, allowing exploration of different approaches.</p>
        <h3>Incremental Growth</h3>
        <p>Just like a baby, NEAT networks start simple and gradually add complexity, ensuring efficient evolution and avoiding getting overwhelmed.</p>
        
        <h2>The Big Deal</h2>
        <p>NEAT opens up a whole new world of possibilities for AI:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Robotics: Design robots that adapt to their environment, walk on any terrain, or even learn new skills like climbing.</li>
            <li>Game AI: Train agents that strategize, learn from mistakes, and even create their own tactics in games like Pong.</li>
            <li>Creative AI: Generate art, music, and even write stories by evolving neural networks that explore new avenues of expression.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Advancements and Extensions</h2>
        <p>But NEAT isn't alone! Researchers are constantly building on its foundations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HyperNEAT: Optimizes not just network topology, but also the evolution process itself!</li>
            <li>Compositional Pattern Producing NEAT (CPPN): Creates modular neural networks, easier to understand and adapt for specific tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Implementation</h2>
        <p>Here is the GitHub repository for my implementation of the NEAT-python library to make a Pong game play itself. The game iterates through generations and multiple paddles. Each generation filters out and selects the best performing paddle. The genealogy of this paddle is transferred onto the next generations for improving the neural network. Please feel free to try it out for yourself, make sure to tweak the config file to improve model performance.</p>
